PROJECT-6-UNDERSTANDING-CLIENT-SERVER-ARCHITECTURE

I Started the project by researching and understanding the basic terminologies: Client, Server and Architecture.
I further went ahead to understand the theoretical explanation with examples of Client-server Architecture.
Next, i went ahead to understand the command curl, then study about ping and traceroute.

Below are the steps i followed to implement a client-serer Architecture using MYSQL Database Management System

1. I created two linux based servers; mysqlserver and mysql client
2. I installed the mysql server software on both mysqlserver and my sqlclient
3. I then configured the inbound rules in mysql server.
4. Next, i configured mysqlserver to allow connection from remote host
5. From the mysql client, i connected to the remote mysql server database.
6. I then ran the command Showdatabases; to check that i have successfully connected to a remote mysql server and can perform some queries

 Below are screenshots of my activities
